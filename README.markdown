#Simple Basecamp API Wrapper

I didn't like the incompleteness of the other python basecamp api wrappers, so I wrote my own incomplete python api wrapper for basecamp. 

It works decently well. 

A little known secret about the basecamp API. On some interfaces, if you replace .xml with .json it will return json. This isn't supported on all interfaces though. 

###Todo
There is a lot of stuff to fix

* Convert the xml responses to python objects
* add support for adding, updating and deleting objects
* finish the api coverage
* add tests
* make money
